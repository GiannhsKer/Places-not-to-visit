    "Embarrassing service. Very expensive for the quality and quantity of food served. Waiting time is ridiculous. Only positive is the view. Staff is nice but clearly either overwhelmed or incompetent.": {

    "My husband and I stayed at Au Major Davel and it was so incredible. From the spectacular view of the lake, to the gastronomic restaurant to the town of Cully itself. We busted both Lausanne and Montreux and we loved Cully so much more. It was so quiet and magical. The hotel staff were the kindest folks we have met on our trip! High recommend!!": {
